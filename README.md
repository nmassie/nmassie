Hi all, my name is Natanael Waraney Gerald Massie from Jakarta, Indonesia. People usually call me Waran or Natanael for short. In this class, I hope to further delve into the interactions between the computer systems implemented using the techniques I have learnt in the previous courses (CIT 591 up to 594, especially 593) and better appreciate the complexity of the interconnected computer systems and networks I use everyday. Looking forward to the class!
